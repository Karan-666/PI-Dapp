This project is named PI-Dapp, which stands for 'Prediction and Insurance based Decentralised Application.' This project had initiated during my blockchain internship at IIT Patna. The project uses a combination of both Machine Learning and blockchain technology. The Machine-Learning part is for prediction, and blockchain is for building trust and providing insurance.

I used Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with image processing, (Deep Learning) for Machine Learning and Smart Contracts (Solidity), truffle, ganache, web3, chai, NodeJS Framework, and IPFS for BlockChain.
